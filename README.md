Bathroom Chore Calendar

The Gist
This app adds three names per day to a monthly calendar that's meant to be printed out.

The Task
This was created out of the need to assign daily clean up duties of three bathrooms to the group of residents who use them. I was to create this list, print it out and post it in a common area for people to read.

The Problem
The list was currently being create using MS Word. This presented a problem in that few of the staff knew how to use it and therefore the list suffered in terms of either not getting updated and or a loss of appearance due to the staff editing it by hand.

The Solution
Using a web based approach the Bathroom Chore Calendar provides a comprehensive solution while addressing the ease of use issue.

The Details
The app was made primarliy using FullCalendar, jQueryUI, HTML5 Local Storage and CoffeeScript.
